From the elaborate garments worn by the clergy to the sumptuous textiles and intricate embellishments found in religious art, the aesthetics of Catholicism have left an indelible mark on the world of fashion. The theme also encouraged guests to consider the deeper symbolic and spiritual dimensions of fashion, exploring the ways in which clothing can serve as a form of expression, identity, and ritual.
