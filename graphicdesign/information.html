    The Met Gala theme "Camp: Notes on Fashion" was inspired by Susan Sontag's seminal essay "Notes on 'Camp'" published in 1964. Sontag defined camp as a sensibility that is characterized by its love of the unnatural, of artifice and exaggeration, and by its celebration of style over content. It's about embracing the aesthetics of excess, irony, and theatricality.

    For the 2019 Met Gala, the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art chose to explore this theme, inviting attendees to interpret and embody the essence of camp in their fashion choices. This theme encouraged a departure from traditional notions of elegance and sophistication, instead embracing flamboyance, extravagance, and a sense of playfulness.

<p>
Sontag's landmark essay was published in 1964 and now, 55 years later, it's being celebrated as the seminal literary work on the topic of camp fashion. Part of what makes her commentary so significant is that she found a way to describe a burgeoning, flamboyant sensibility that was still under-the-radar at the time. In 2019, camp is practically everywhere and defines so much of our daily lives. Sontag was nothing short of a fortune teller.
</p>
<p>
"The essence of Camp is its love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration," she writes in her essay. "Camp is esoteric… something of a private code, a badge of identity even among small urban cliques… I am strongly drawn to Camp, and almost as strongly offended by it."
</p>


<p> 

That conflicting mix of attraction and displeasure is what makes camp fashion such a paradox. It can simultaneously be beautiful and overwhelmingly tacky. Sontag's definition of camp has typically been summed up as failed seriousness. "The whole point of Camp is to dethrone the serious," Sontag explains. "Camp is playful, anti-serious. More precisely, Camp involves a new, more complex relation to ‘the serious.’ One can be serious about the frivolous, frivolous about the serious."

In terms of fashion, camp can be expressed through a variety of elements:
</p>
<p>  
    Exaggerated Silhouettes: Camp fashion often features exaggerated proportions and theatrical silhouettes. This can include oversized ruffles, voluminous skirts, dramatic sleeves, and larger-than-life accessories.
    Bold Colors and Patterns: Camp embraces bold and vibrant colors, as well as playful patterns and prints. Think neon hues, metallics, animal prints, and psychedelic designs.
    Kitschy and Whimsical Details: Camp fashion incorporates kitschy and whimsical details that add a sense of fun and frivolity to an outfit. This can include sequins, feathers, fur, fringe, and other playful embellishments.
    References to Pop Culture and Iconography: Camp often draws inspiration from pop culture icons, symbols, and references. This can include nods to celebrities, movies, music, and other elements of popular culture, reinterpreted in a humorous or exaggerated manner.
    Irony and Parody: Camp fashion often involves a sense of irony and parody, playfully poking fun at conventional notions of style and beauty. It's about embracing the idea of "bad taste" and turning it into something fabulous.
    High-Low Mashups: Camp blurs the lines between high and low culture, mixing elements of haute couture with everyday or mass produced items. It's about elevating the mundane and finding beauty in the unexpected.
    At the 2019 Met Gala, celebrities, designers, and fashion enthusiasts embraced the camp theme with enthusiasm, showcasing a diverse range of creative interpretations on the red carpet. From Lady Gaga's multiple outfit changes to Billy Porter's extravagant entrance carried by six shirtless men, the event was a spectacle of avant-garde fashion and theatricality, celebrating the playful and irreverent spirit of camp.
